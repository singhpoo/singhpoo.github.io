### About Me
Hi there, I‚Äôm Pooja ‚Äì a caffeine-fueled explorer of all things tech!
I moved from India to the US in 2016 to pursue my MS at USC, and since then, I've been on a mission to automate all things boring‚Äîbecause who wants to waste time on mundane tasks? With over 7 years of experience as a Full Stack Engineer, I‚Äôve dabbled in everything from frontend wizardry to backend sorcery, cloud technologies, and even applied ML.

Lately, I‚Äôve been diving deep into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs)‚Äîit‚Äôs an exciting time to be a developer! I spend my free time building applications that leverage the power of LLMs, transforming complex ideas into simple, user-friendly solutions. üöÄ

When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me outdoors‚Äîwhether it's hiking, backpacking, scuba diving, bouldering, or planning my next road trip. I have 2 reactive dogs who I love and adore. They‚Äôre a work in progress, but it‚Äôs a rewarding challenge!

I enjoy connecting with new people and building relationships. Recently, I started meditating to stay grounded and combat seasonal blues here in Seattle. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So if you‚Äôre looking for someone who‚Äôs passionate about building innovative applications and enjoys a good cup of coffee (or three), let‚Äôs connect!
